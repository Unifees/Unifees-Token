# Unifees-Token
Despite millions of cross-border fee transactions being made every day, the transaction process remains cumbersome for many. The transfer process is usually time-consuming; conversion and transfer charges make it an extra burden on the pocket. On the other hand, relying on third-party agents makes it more complicated. Unifees comes up with a solution to this burning problem in the form of proprietary token “FEES”, designed on blockchain technology that will provide innovative ways to decipher the existing nodus in this payment transfer process.  Unifees is here to incentivize the fees payment process by creating a transparent environment for everyone.
